    	<h2>Class Overview</h2>

    	<p>Playing a class in an Battlegame is a chance to combine physical abilities with tactical and strategic acumen to achieve victory. Classes in Amtgard are designed so that each one brings a unique and valuable set of skills to the field which can be used as part of a team.</p>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Portraying a Class</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This section contains a few examples of archetypal medieval and fantasy character types. While the names of the classes reflects a European centric viewpoint, that does not define how you must portray them. You can easily play the <a href="Fighter/barbarian.html">Barbarian</a> or <a href="Fighter/warrior.html">Warrior</a> classes as a samurai or the <a href="Magic/healer.html">Healer</a> as a necromancer. With a little flair and creativity, the <a href="Fighter/scout.html">Scout</a> class makes an excellent pirate. Your character and persona are defined through your actions and behavior, not the name of the class that gives you your abilities. The class es exist in a strict form to maintain game balance on the field; it is up to you to give them life, substance, and personality. <br>
    			Classes are listed on the following manner:</p>
    		<p><b>Name: </b> the name of the class. <br>
    			<b>Role-Play Suggestion: </b>This lists historical or fantasy examples of each class plus a brief overview. <br>
    			<b>Garb: </b>Garb that is required to denote playing the class. You are required to dress in medieval/sword and sorcery looking garb in addition to the class specific garb. Failure to do either will result in playing the <a href="Fighter/peasant.html">Peasant</a> class. <br>
    			<b>Requirement: </b>A few classes list experience requirements. If you do not meet these requirements you may not play nor gain credits in that class. <br>
    			<b>Look the Part: </b>This is an extra Ability that is available to the player if they actively role-play or portray their class. Examples would be acting consistently in character in battlegames, having good class-specific gar, and meanigfully contributing to the atmosphere of the game. This ability need not meet a cookie-cutter definition of the class; any dedicated behavior consistent with a backstory can work. <a href="Fighter/barbarian.html">Barbarian</a>, for example. could be played as a refined Samurai rather than a raging viking and still qualify for the bonus. Look the Part abilities are available at first level and are in addition to all other class abilities. Example: A player has the Look the Part ability <a href="../Spells/Schools/Sorcery/scavenge.html">Scavenge</a> 1/Life and a normal class ability of Scavenge 1/Life would have Scavenge 2/Life. Who qualifies for Look the Part is game-by-game bonus awarded by the group monarch or joint decision of the game reeve and the guildmaster for the class. <br>
    			<b>Armor: </b>Maximum point value of armor the class may wear. You can wear <a href="../Armor&#38;Shields/Armor/armor.html">Armor</a> with a point value higher then you are allowed use of, but in these cases the armor simply gives you the maximum allowed for your class. Example: a <a href="Fighter/scout.html">Scout</a> wearing full plate still only gets three points from it. <br>
    			<b>Shields: </b>Largest sized <a href="../Armor&#38;Shields/shields.html">Shield</a> the class can use. <br>
    			<b>Limitations: </b>Some classes have restrictions. For example, <a href="Fighter/barbarian.html">Barbarians</a> are restricted from receiving <a href="../Spells/enchantments.html">Enchantments</a> from other classes. <br>
    			<b>Levels and Abilities: </b>Most classes recieve Abilities at each level. Some Abilities are presented as a choice. Ability choices may be changed before each new game. Any Ability choice presented as 'Choose x of y' allows you to choose up to x of the following y abilities. No duplicates may be chosen unless otherwise noted.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Credits and Levels</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>If you wish to fight or participate in a battlegame, you must conform to one class for each game. A person may advance in level in a class after having the requisite credits and passing a class test administered by your class Guildmaster. Only one attendance credit may be given on a single day, although Kingdoms may award bonus credits according to their corpora. You must play the class you wish to gain credit in. If no class is played but fighting takes place, you may take a Warrior credit. Players who reeve may take a Reeve Credit, and players who otherwise participate may take a Color Credit. Kingdoms are allowed to award a maximum of 12 total bonus credits (credits above and beyond attendance credits) to any player in a single month and no more than 3 bonus credits may be issued per 1 attendance credit. All classes gain new abilities and levels at the following rate:</p>
	    	<table>
	    		<tr>
	    			<th>1st</th>
	    			<td>Less than 5 credits in that class</td>
	    		</tr>
	    		<tr>
	    			<th>2nd</th>
	    			<td>At least 5 and less than 12 credits in that class</td>
	    		</tr>
	    		<tr>
	    			<th>3rd</th>
	    			<td>At least 12 and less than 21 credits in that class</td>
	    		</tr>
	    		<tr>
	    			<th>4th</th>
	    			<td>At least 21 and less than 34 credits in that class</td>
	    		</tr>
	    		<tr>
	    			<th>5th</th>
	    			<td>At least 34 and less than 53 credits in that class</td>
	    		</tr>
	    		<tr>
	    			<th>6th</th>
	    			<td>53 or more credits in that class</td>
	    		</tr>
	    	</table>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Monsters</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>No sword and sorcery setting is complete without monsters, those creatures from imagination or legend, both good and evil, that are somehow more (or less) than human. Monsters in Amtgard can represent the smallest, friendliest sprite, the largest most fearsome dragon, or anything in between.</p>
    		<p><b>Examples: </b>Centaurs, Dragons, Dwarves, Werewolves, Vampires, Deadly Slime.</p>
    		<p>Monster is a special class, playable only in games where th game designer and local monarch have given their permission for the class to be used. A player's level in the Monster class determines which Monsters they may portray. For more information and rules regarding the Monster class please refer to the <a href="../Monster%20Rulebook/index.html">Monster Rulebook</a>.</p>
