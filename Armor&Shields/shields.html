    	<h2>Shields</h2>

    	<p>Shields are used to block shots from weapons and are impervious to harm except from certain abilities and magics. All shield measurements are the exterior surface area on a flat plane.</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Must not break or bend significantly during the course of combat. Rigid or easily breakable foam, or kow-density foams, are inappropriate for all-foam shield construction. Some acceptable materials are:
    			<ol type="a">
    				<li>Sturdy high-density foam.</li>
    				<li>Plywood.</li>
    				<li>High impact plastics.</li>
    				<li>Aluminum.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</li>
    		<li>Must have an opaque, durable cover such as cloth or PlastiDip.</li>
    		<li>The rim and face of the shield must be padded by at least 1" of closed cell foam.
    			<ol type="a">
    				<li>All-foam shields do not require any additional padding so long as the foam itself would be considered padding.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</li>
    		<li>Hard edges may not be exposed on any surface which can reasonably come into contact with another player of their equipment.</li>
    		<li>A player may only wear one shield at a time.</li>
    		<li>Must be gripped in a hand in order to be considered wielded.
    			<ol type="a">
    				<li>A shield that is gripped in a hand may also have a support strap around the arm.</li>
    				<li>A blow that strikes a non-wielded shield strapped to a player, such as a shield slung across a back, is considered to strike the player as if the shield had not been there.</li>
    				<li>A small shield may be strapped to an arm instead of wielded in a hand.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</li>
    		<li>A small shield is between 36" squared (6.8" diameter) and 3' squared (23.45" diameter).</li>
    		<li>A medium shield is no larger than 5' squared (30.28" diameter).</li>
    		<li>A large shield is no larger than 8' squared (30.28" diameter).</li>
    		<li>Non-round shields may not be wider than 2'.</li>
    		<li>A shield may be tossed in a manner that keeps it (relatively) perpendicular to the ground. While in the air, such a shield is considerd a terrain effect, though it is still vulnerable to things that would normally affect a shield (such as <a href="../Spells/Schools/Flame/fireball.html">Fireball</a> or <a href="../Spells/Schools/Sorcery/destruction-arrow.html">Destruction Arrow</a>. A shield may not be tossed into another player or thier wielded equipment.</li>
    	</ol>
