    	<h3>Armor Construction and General Modifiers</h3>
    	
    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Armor Construction</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<ol>
    		<li>The Monarch, Champion, and Guildmaster of Reeves rate armor.</li>
    		<li>Armor that is of mixed values across the same area will be averaged based on the percentage of each type of coverage of the area, rounding fractions to the nearest whole number. Example: An arm with a Plate bracer (5 AP) covering 30% of the arm and a Chainmail sleeve (3 AP) covering 70% of the arm will result in an armor value of (.3*5) + (.7*3) = 3.6 = 4 AP across the entire location.</li>
    		<li>Armor should weigh close to actual historical standards to receive full value.</li>
    		<li>Straps and other such material that hold your armor on do not count as part of the armor, for either coverage or averaging purposes, unless they are specifically built as such. Example: the leather strap across your back holding on your steel breastplate does not protect you from hits.</li>
    		<li>A gambeson must be at least equivalent to Cloth armor. A gambeson must be worn under all armor on a hit location in order to give a bonus. A gambeson which extends past the area covered by the armor it is supporting may be either treated as garb or averaged as Cloth armor at the discretion of the wearer on a per-location basis.</li>
    		<li>All armor must be safe, with no protruding edges that could injure someone.</li>
    		<li>All corners on any armor that will not deform under contact must come to a point no sharper than the radius of a penny.</li>
    		<li>Armor that is made from synthetic materials such as vinyl, plastic, etc may be used but may never be rated higher than 2 Armor Points.</li>
    		<li>Armor is considered to be of the type it most closely resembles. Example: leather with small plates or studs attached at 1‚Äù intervals is still leather armor, it is not Butted Plate with a negative modifier.</li>
    		<li>Armor that is initially rated as zero points does not count as armor. Armor that has been depleted continues to be considered armor, but does not continue to stop wounds until restored.</li>
    	</ol>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">General Modifiers</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>These modifiers may be applied to any type armor as appropriate. See the description of the specific armor types below for specific modifiers.</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><b>Inferior Construction: </b>Up to two points can be deducted for armor that is substantially less protective or durable than standard construction techniques. Example: shoddy workmanship, larger ring diameter, lighter gauge, etc.</li>
	    		<li><b>Non-Standard Metal: </b>One point is deducted for metal armor that is less protective or lighter than steel. Example: titanium, bronze, etc. Metal which is both less protective and lighter has one point deducted for each. Example: Aluminum.</li>
	    		<li><b>Inferior Appearance: </b>Up to two points can be deducted for inferior appearance, unrelated to the construction techniques used. Example: obviously unfinished armor, visible inauthentic materials, or tarnished/poorly maintained armor. This does not apply if the armor is intentionally made to look shoddy for an in-game purpose, such as monster/ barbarian armor. Armor may receive this penalty regardless of construction quality.</li>
	    		<li><b>Superior Construction: </b>Up to one point may be awarded for armor that substantially exceeds the defensive properties of the standard materials or uses superior construction techniques zsuch as fluting, heavier thickness/gauge materials, hardening, smaller ring diameter, etc. May not be awarded in combination with the same specific armor type modifier. Example: A +1 cannot be awarded twice for fluting on Articulated Plate.</li>
	    		<li><b>Superior Appearance: </b>Up to one point may be awarded for exceptional appearance unrelated to the construction techniques used. Examples include extensive and well-done tooling of leather, appealing addition of studs and/or rings, etching of metal, gilding, blueing, etc. Armor receiving a modifier for Inferior Construction is not eligible for this bonus.</li>
	    		<li><b>Helm: </b>Up to one point may be awarded to the worn torso armor for wearing a helm on the head. The helm must cover at least 50% of the area from the base of the neck upwards. The helm must be of a historical or swords and sorcery fantasy design. The helm bonus is negated if the helm is removed. <br>
	    		There are two types of helms: Light Helms, and Heavy Helms. Light Helms (e.g. arming cap, coif, etc.) must meet the requirements of at least Strong Leather or Chainmail armor. The torso armor bonus received for a Light Helm may not exceed the maximum value for the armor type. Heavy Helms (e.g. Spangenhelm, Crusader Helm) must meet the requirements of Plate armor and additionally be made of at least 16 gauge metal. The torso armor bonus received from a Heavy Helm may allow the wearer to exceed the maximum value for the armor type.</li>

    		<p>This armor is constructed from numerous shaped amd fited overlapping metal plates solidly connected along one edge to an exterior shell of heavy cloth (such as canvas, denim, or velvet) in such a way that when worn all places are held together firmly without any gaps between them and follow the genral contours of the body. This armor provides good protection against both impact and penetration. <br>

Plates must be shaped and fitted so as to follow the general contours of the wearer. <br>

    		<p>Plate armor is the pinnacle of medieval armor and offers excellent protection against both impact and penetration. Plate armor forms a solid metal shell over the protected areas that spreads impact over a large sueface area to mitigate concussive force. The individual metal pieces of plate armor are shaped and fitted  to articulate together and follow the contours of the body. Plate armor will not deform locally when struck, but will instead behave as a single continuous whole. <br>
	    	<b>Base Armor Points: </b>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Maximum Armor Points: </b>6 <br>
	    	<b>Requirements: </b>Metal used must be at least 1.22mm (18 gauge) steel. At least 75% of the protected area must be covered by individual plates which are large relative to the hit location protected; Plate is large individual continuous pieces of metal connected together to form a whole, not a large number of smaller plates. Each plate must be firmly attached to all neighboring plates by strapping or metal-on-metal articulation in such a way as to form a rigid dhell when worn. Armor may still be flexible where necessary for mobility. <br>
