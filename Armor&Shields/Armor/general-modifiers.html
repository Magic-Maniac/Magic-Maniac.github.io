    	<h2>General Modifiers</h2>

    	<p><b>General Modifiers: </b>These modifiers may be applied to any type armor as appropriate. See the description of the specific armor types below for specific modifiers.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><b>Inferior Construction: </b>Up to two points can be deducted for armor that is substantially less protective or durable than standard construction techniques. Example: shoddy workmanship, larger ring diameter, lighter gauge, etc.</li>
    		<li><b>Non-Standard Metal: </b>One point is deducted for metal armor that is less protective or lighter than steel. Example: titanium, bronze, etc. Metal which is both less protective and lighter has one point deducted for each. Example: Aluminum.</li>
    		<li><b>Inferior Appearance: </b>Up to two points can be deducted for inferior appearance, unrelated to the construction techniques used. Example: obviously unfinished armor, visible inauthentic materials, or tarnished/poorly maintained armor. This does not apply if the armor is intentionally made to look shoddy for an in-game purpose, such as monster/ barbarian armor. Armor may receive this penalty regardless of construction quality.</li>
    		<li><b>Superior Construction: </b>Up to one point may be awarded for armor that substantially exceeds the defensive properties of the standard materials or uses superior construction techniques zsuch as fluting, heavier thickness/gauge materials, hardening, smaller ring diameter, etc. May not be awarded in combination with the same specific armor type modifier. Example: A +1 cannot be awarded twice for fluting on Articulated Plate.</li>
    		<li><b>Superior Appearance: </b>Up to one point may be awarded for exceptional appearance unrelated to the construction techniques used. Examples include extensive and well-done tooling of leather, appealing addition of studs and/or rings, etching of metal, gilding, blueing, etc. Armor receiving a modifier for Inferior Construction is not eligible for this bonus.</li>
    		<li><b>Helm: </b>Up to one point may be awarded to the worn torso armor for wearing a helm on the head. The helm must cover at least 50% of the area from the base of the neck upwards. The helm must be of a historical or swords and sorcery fantasy design. The helm bonus is negated if the helm is removed. <br>
    		There are two types of helms: Light Helms, and Heavy Helms. Light Helms (e.g. arming cap, coif, etc.) must meet the requirements of at least Strong Leather or Chainmail armor. The torso armor bonus received for a Light Helm may not exceed the maximum value for the armor type. Heavy Helms (e.g. Spangenhelm, Crusader Helm) must meet the requirements of Plate armor and additionally be made of at least 16 gauge metal. The torso armor bonus received from a Heavy Helm may allow the wearer to exceed the maximum value for the armor type.</li>
    	</ul>
