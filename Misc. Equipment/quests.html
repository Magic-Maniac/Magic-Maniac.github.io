    	<h2>Quests</h2>

    	<p>Quests are a special type of battlegame that offer a more free-form set of objectives than what is normally available. A good quest should contain multiple objectives and have multiple methods of achieving those objectives. A good quest allows players to achieve success by thinking and role-playing as well as by fighting. Finally, quests typically make use of the Quest Abilities avaliable to each class.</p>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Example Relic Quest</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Individual teams scour the forest to find powerful magic items protected by various monsters and held in chests spread throughout the forest. The chests are lockerd and the monsters have unmarked keys that they hand out when they are defeated. Each monster should also have a demand. Demands should only be straight-foward tasks the questors can performto get a key from the monster. A good example demand might be 'bring me the magic orb hidden in the forest'. Demands should only be sated by the monster when asked. Questors must role-play in order to discover a monsters demand. For added realism, have real locks on real wooden boxes and have the monstershand out actual keys when they are searched by questors. The questors can choose to either turn in relics they find to their team reeve when they ar found or to start using them in the quest. If they use them in the quest then the relics may be looted from their bodies by other quest teams.</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Teams: </b>2+</li>
    			<li><b>Lives: </b>Unlimited. The quest ends after 1 hour.</li>
    			<li><b>Respawn: </b>Players respawn at their team reeve in 60 seconds once their team is out of combat</li>
    			<li><b>Players: </b>2+ per team, a neutral reeve for every team, a head reeve, and 1 monster every three players</li>
    			<li><b>Refresh: </b>Abilities Refresh at the 30 minute mark</li>
    			<li><b>Types Best Supported: </b>Full Class</li>

    	<h3>Quest Abilities</h3>

    	<p>Quest Abilities are designed to give players more tools in role-play situations that are common in Quest-type battlegames. These Abilities are typically not useful in standard battlegames as they focus more on interaction with a storyline and monsters than they do with combat between players. Quest Abilities are chosen by, or assigned to, each player before the battlegame begins. The reeve in charge of the battlegame will announce which Quest Abilities, if any, are available to be chosen for a given game and how they are to be selected.</p>

    	<hr>

    	<h3>Quest Abilities Defined</h3>

    	<p>Quest Abilities are activated by announcing the name of the Quest Ability at an appropriate time to the flow of the Quest. For instance Hollowed Ground would need to be announced before combat is initiated whereas Menace can be announced before or after a player attempts to threaten and bully a group of monsters</p>

If a player uses a Quest Ability in a way that is disruptive to play or derives an unbalancing gameplay advantage, disallow it.</p>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Quest Ability Hooks</button>
    	<div class="content">

    		<ol>
    			<li>Hooks should never be unsolvable without a Quest Ability; just more difficult or require a different approach.</li>
    			<li>Hooks should never preclude a player's natural abilities, just augment them. For example if a player is confronted by town guards they could attempt to fight their way through or run. The player could also choose to try and name-drop their relationship (real or fake) with a powerful novle in an attempt to bypass a fight. A player who invokes Court Knowledge is more likely to be belived by the guards than a player without it, given the same performance.</li>
    			<li>Encourage your NPCs, monsters, and reeves to have fun with Quest Abilities by playing along and acting out the effects of a Quest Ability dramatically where appropriate</li>
    			<li>Don't feel obligated to provide Hooks for every Quest Ability, but do provide Hools for a variety of different Quest Abilities that fit the theme and content of your game. Turn Undead might not be useful when raiding an orc village, and that's okay. Tribal Knowledge probably would be.</li>
    			<li>Hooks should add to the flavor and fun of a battlegame, not slow it down or detract from it. It's better to cut a bad Hook rather than try and cram it when it doesn't belong.</li>
