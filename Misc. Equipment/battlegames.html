    	<h2>Battlegames</h2>

    	<p>Battlegames are competitive matches between two or more teams using a variety of different possible mechanics. Victory is determined by any number of pre-set conditions. This Section describes the mechanics and components of battlegames, how to build your own, and lists some example common battlegames.</p>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Battlegame Components</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>these are the individual pieces that make up how a game works. These parts can be mixed and matched to create any number of possible different games. A game essentially has seven parts:</p>

   			<p><b>Lives: </b>How many times players can return to life. This can be a fixed number per player, or a fixed number per team, unlimited, or something else. <br>
   				<b>Respawn: </b>Where and when players return to life. This can be after a period of time, instantly, in groups of a minimum size, at base, where they died, in a central location or something else. Players who Respawn so so with all of their equipment intact, Wounds healed, <a href="../Spells/enchantments.html">Enchantments</a> removed, and all States and Ongoing Effects removed unless other wise noted. When designing a game keep in mind that dying should generally be the worst thing that can happen on the field. For instance when designing a Full-Class game your Respawn counnts should not be shorter than the longest negative effect on the field effect (60 seconds because of <a href="../Spells/magic-balls.html">Magic Balls</a>). Alternatively dying can be penalized by having a finite life pool for the team as a whole. <br>
   				<b>Base: </b>Some <a href="../Spells/magic.html">Magic and Abilities</a> refer to 'returning to base' or otherwise reference the location of a base. Bases may also be used to repair a broken weapon, bow, or shield after 60 second at base, though this may be adjusted by the game designer. Determin what the bases will be for these abilities for each team. This can be a fixed location, a team reeve, or something else. <br>
   				<b>Game Type: </b>the Game Type refers to the set of rules used to play a Battlegame. The common Game Types are:</p>
   				<ul>
   					<li><b>Ditch: </b>No classes, no armor, no projectiles, no siege, shields are unbreakable.</li>
   					<li><b>Militia: </b>No classes, armor is used, projectiles are used, shields are breakable.</li>
   					<li><b>Full-Class No Magic: </b>Classes are used except for <a href="../Classes/Magic/magic-classes.html">Magic Classes</a>.</li>
   					<li><b>Full-Class: </b>All classes are used.</li>
   					<li><b>Quest: </b>See <a href="quests.html">'Quests'</a>.</li>
   					<li><b>Other: </b>See your group leaders for the rules for Jugging, Orcball, etc.</li>
   				</ul>
   				<p><b>Teams: </b>the number of teams that play in the game. This is commonly two or three, but may also be:</p>
   				<ul>
   					<li><b>By Size: </b>Players divide into any number of teams with no more than X players per team</li>
   					<li><b>Free for All: </b>Every player for themselves</li>
   				</ul>
   				<p><b>Objectives: </b>the win condition for the teams. This can be Eliminate the other team, eliminate a specific player, score points, survive, or something else. <br>
   					<b>Refresh: </b>How and when per-Refresh abilities are returned to full uses in Class games. This could be none, every 30 minutes, when teams rotate, when a point is scored, or something else. Refreshes should be infrequent in order to encourage plauers to use their per-Refresh abilities tactically and thoughtfully. <br>
   					<b>Scenario Rules: </b>Any specific rules that modify the way the game is played. This could involve monsters, ruling out specific classes, creating off-limit areas, creating special-effect areas, or anything else.</p>

   					<p>Combine different components in different ways to create entirely different game types to suit the needs of the group. A good battlegame is fast-paced and focuses on providing constructive conflict for all opposing teams. Combatis a means of resolving conflict, but should be a goak in and of itself. Downtime for players should be minimal, but kiling the opponent should still provide a meaningful advantage to the killer or their team.</p>

    	<h3>Battlegame Examples</h3>

    	<p>Battlegames can take any form imaginable or desirable by the group. The best game type for the group will be dictated by the size of the area, number of players, available time, and available terrain. The games listed here are just common examples to stir the imagination and can be played as they are or customized in any way.</p>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Capture the Flag</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Two or more teams compete to secure a flag at their base in order to score points. First team to three points wins. The flag is considered a game object. This game is fun to play in the woods or other areas with interesting terrain.</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Teams: </b>2+</li>
    			<li><b>Lives: </b>Unlimited</li>
    			<li><b>Respawn: </b>Instant at base</li>
    			<li><b>Players: </b>5+ per team</li>
    			<li><b>Objective: </b>Bring the game flag to your base and hold it there for five seconds in order to score a point. Once a point is scored all teams reset their bases.</li>
    			<li><b>Refresh: </b>Every 45 minutes of play time</li>

    		</ul>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Ditching</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Two teams line up across from each other just out of melee range and fight until one team is eliminated. New players join the losing team before the next round starts. If no new players are ready to join then the first dead on the winning team switches to the losing team before the nexr round starts. This is the simplest of all Battlegames and a good pickup game. Best played in medium-sized, open areas.</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Teams: </b>2</li>
    			<li><b>Lives: </b>1</li>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Ring the Bell</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Two teams attempt to hit the 'Bell' at the other teams base first. Bells must be touched by a player, or by a weapon under 36"currently held by a player, to be rung. First team to three points wins. This game is fun to play in small, open areas.</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Teams: </b>2</li>
    			<li><b>Lives: </b>Unlimited</li>
    			<li><b>Respawn: </b>Start of round at base</li>

    		</ul>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Very Heavy Object</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Two teams attempt to bring the Object to their opponents base to score a point. The Object must be kept at the opponents base for five seconds in order to score a point. The Object is considered a game item and should weigh at least 30lbs. First team to three pointes wins. This game is fun to play in medium sized areas with interesting terrain.</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Teams: </b>2</li>
    			<li><b>Lives: </b>Unlimited</li>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Castle Defense</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>One team defends, two teams attack. Rotate teans so each team has a chance to defend and two chances to attack. The team that wins is the team that defends the castle (or any given location) the longest before being eliminated. This game is fun to play in any place where you have a defensible location.</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Teams: </b>3</li>
    			<li><b>Lives: </b>Unlimited for the attackers, life pool for the defenders</li>
