    	<h2>Weapon Construction</h2>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Core</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to the base of the Weapon to which padding is affixed. For Melee Weapon cores the best things to use are carbon/graphite rods (such as from non-metallic golf clubs), kite spar, bamboo, PVC tubing or fiberglass. Other materials will be checked for safety on a case-by-case basis. Metal and wooden cores are not legal, although metal may be used to counter-weight weapons provided it is permanently attached, and not in a place that may inadvertently strike an opponent. The ends of all Weapon cores must be blunted by capping them with a layer of foam and tape at a minimum. For throwing Weapons acceptable options are denim, loose rubberbands, sweatshirt material, or similar.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Handle</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Refers to the unpadded part of the Weapon (where it is often held).</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pommel</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to the padded portion of a Weapon at the end of the handle, not intended for striking. The end of the pommel must have at least a 2” cross-section perpendicular to the handle and must be padded.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Cross Guard</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to an optional piece at the juncture of the blade and handle designed to deflect blows and protect the hand from injury. Cross guards must be padded and all tips must have at least a 2” cross section parallel to the handle.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Double-Ended</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Only Weapon Types with this descriptor may have a striking surface at both ends. This may be either a Stabbing Tip or a Slash edge unless otherwise restricted by the Weapon Type. Must still adhere to the construction requirements of the Weapon Type for the extra striking surface. Example: A 6ft Great Weapon could have a striking surface on each end with a minimum of 18” of Strike-Legal in order to slash with both ends OR could have one 18” slashing end and one 6” thrusting end. Both configurations would require each end to be 1/3rd padded.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Stabbing Tip</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to the end of a weapon that is not the pommel, regardless of whether or not it is used to stab. Stabbing tips must not protrude more than 1.5” through a 2.5” ring when uncompressed, nor end in an angle less than 90 degrees. You must not be able to feel core through a stabbing tip.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Padded or Courtesy Padding</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to the portion of the weapon that is designed to limit injuries from incidental contact with that part of the Weapon and is not intended for striking. These portions of a Weapon should have at least 1/2” of foam over the Weapon’s core. A Weapon is required to have courtesy padding over the entire circumference of its Strike-Legal length.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Strike-Legal</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to the portions of the Weapon that are sufficiently padded to prevent injury when used to strike an opponent at full force. These portions may not break bones, teeth, or regularly leave bruises when it strikes a person and must have at least one 2.5” cross section from edge to edge. Strike-Legal surfaces must have at least 1” of foam over the Weapon Core, measured from the furthest point on the blade to the surface of the core. Stab-only Weapons (other than projectiles) are still required to have 6” of Strike-Legal surface extending from the end of the weapon down its length on any stabbing end for safety. Strike-Legal must be covered in a durable, opaque cloth. Unless otherwise noted, cloth tape is not an acceptable cover. Non-striking padded surfaces within 1/2” of a striking surface must still be covered with a cloth cover.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Heavy Padding</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>This refers to portions of the Weapon that meet all of the requirements of Strike-Legal, and in addition have at least a 4” cross section from edge to edge and at least 1” of foam over the Weapon Core. It is considered Strike-Legal for the purposes of scoring hits.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Total Length</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Refers to the distance from the bottom of the pommel to the furthest point of the Weapon measured from the bottom of the pommel in a straight line parallel to the core of the Weapon. Example: You measure a scimitar from the bottom of the pommel to the tip of the Eeapon, not “along the curve.”</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Swing/Slash</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Indicates a Weapon intended to be able to score a hit by swinging the Weapon in such a way that the side (as opposed to the tip) of the Weapon strikes an opponent.</p>
    	</div>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Thrust/Stab</button>
    	<div class="content">
    		<p>Indicates a Weapon intended to be able to score a hit by thrusting the Weapon in such a way that the tip (as opposed to the sides) of the Weapon strikes an opponent. Thrust only Weapons must have at least 6” of Strike-Legal padding.</p>
